# Indeed_JobTitle_Scrapper
This code uses Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape job listings information from Indeed.com. It opens a webdriver, enters a search query, clicks the search button, and uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content. The script extracts relevant information, including job title, company, and location, and outputs it to the console.
